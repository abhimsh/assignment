    "1. In Python, what is the difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function? Provide an example of each.\\\n",
    "Ans:\\\n",
    "Built-In functions are the functions that are already defined inside the python, when we install python all these functions come with it\\\n",
    "User define function are function which developer creates based on the need of python program for code reuseability.\\\n",

    "2. How can you pass arguments to a function in Python? Explain the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments.\\\n",
    "Ans:\\\n",
    "we can pass values to the functions via parameters/arguements during function call\\\n",
    "when we are passing the values to the function, we can pass as a positional arguement or as keyword arguements\\\n",
    "when values are passed as Positional arguements, the value are assigned to function arguements based on the position of the value during the function call\\\n",
    "when values are passed as Keyword arguements, the parameter names are mentioned and values are assigned to each parameter exclusively, here the position of the arguement/value passed dies not matter\n",

    "5. How does the concept of \"scope\" apply to functions in Python? Explain the difference between local scope and global scope.\\\n",
    "Ans:\\\n",
    "scope of functions refers to the which all code can call the particular function, but when ever the code is executing inside the function block, the code will only have access to the code in local scope(inside the function) and global scope, it can be variable/functions/class\\\n",

    "Local scope:\\\n",
    "The variable in the local scope can only be accessed by the function/code inside that particular function\n",
    "The memory to the local variable is created when the functions inside which the variable is defined is called and the memry is deleted when the code exists that function\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Global Scope:\\\n",
    "The variable in the global scope can be accessed by any function/code inside the program\\\n",
    "The variable in the global scope is created when the program starts executing and the memory will be destroyed when the entire program terminates\\"
