    "1. In Python, what is the difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function? Provide an example of each.\\\n",
    "Ans:\\\n",

    "when we are passing the values to the function, we can pass as a positional arguement or as keyword arguements\\\n",
    "when values are passed as Positional arguements, the value are assigned to function arguements based on the position of the value during the function call\\\n",

    "Ans:\\\n",
    "scope of functions refers to the which all code can call the particular function, but when ever the code is executing inside the function block, the code will only have access to the code in local scope(inside the function) and global scope, it can be variable/functions/class\\\n",

    "7. What is the difference between the \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference\" concepts when it comes to function arguments in Python?\\\n",
    "Ans:\\\n",
    "Pass by value:\\\n",
    "here while calling the function, the values of variable that are passed to the function are copied and the copied value is sent to the fucntion,\\\n",
    "modification made to the values of these variable inside the function will not affect the variable in the calling function\\\n",
    "Pass by reference:\\\n",
    "here while calling the function, the referrence of variable are passed to the function that is called, so \n",
    "modification made to those values inside the function will affect the variable in the calling function\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "python implements call by assignemnt/ call by object reference\\\n",
    "when we pass immuatble datatype variables like str, int, tuple, even though we are passing the reference the values cannot be modified, if the called function tries to modify the value a new local variable will be created inside the function which gets destroyed after function exists\n",
    "When we pass a mutable datatype variables like list, dict,as the reference are passed their values can be modified using these references , so if the called function modifies the values inside the function, the values will be affected in the calling function as well."
